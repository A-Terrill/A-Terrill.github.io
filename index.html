<h2>Angela Terrill</h2>  
<p>Punctilious is a copy-editing, proof reading, language checking and indexing service. I edit scientific books, book chapters, journal articles, grant proposals and dissertations.</p>    

<p>When I copy edit your work I check the spelling and grammar, and I read the language carefully to improve the style, clarity and expression. I also check the broader structure of the paper, making sure that all references are present and correct, and all internal cross references, including section headings, example numbers, table numbers and figure numbers, are correct.</p>  

<p>When I proof read your work I check for spelling and minor grammar errors, including checking that all references are present and correct.</p>  

<p>When I do language checking I take the work of a non-native English speaker and edit it to the level of high quality scientific English.</p>  

<p>As well as editing your work, I can also format your document to your publisher's or journal's house style.</p> 

<p>I also compile indexes.</p> 

<p>I normally have a one-week turnaround time for papers. For longer projects we can negotiate a suitable time frame.</p> 

<p>I have a PhD in linguistics, and 16 years' experience in academic publishing, from first draft to final published product. I am a specialist in editing within the field of linguistics, and I also have extensive experience in other areas within the Humanities.</p>  

<p>I am Production Editor for the journal <a href="https://benjamins.com/#catalog/journals/dia/main">Diachronica</a> and Assistant Editor for <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/lity">Linguistic Typology</a>, as well as Copy Editor for the journals <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/view/journals/lingvan/lingvan-overview.xml">Linguistics Vanguard</a> and <a href="https://brill.com/view/journals/ldc/ldc-overview.xml">Language Dynamics and Change</a>. </p>  

<p>As an Australian based in Sweden, I can edit your work for US, European or other markets. I offer a swift and professional service at a reasonable price.</p>
